# 🎵 Simple Music Composer in Python

This project explores the design of a **simple automatic music composer** using Python.  
The goal is not to write code, but to brainstorm and document the architecture and ideas behind the composer.

---

## 📝 Problem Overview
The aim is to build a program that can **automatically generate short melodies**.  
The generated music should be simple yet structured, allowing the melody to sound coherent.

---

## 📥 Input

The program may require the following information to start:

- **Scale or key** (e.g., C major, A minor)  
- **Tempo** (e.g., 120 BPM)  
- Optional parameters: **mood or length** (e.g., happy, calm, 8 bars)  

**User input consideration:**  
- **With input:** Users can influence style, mood, or length, making the program interactive.  
- **Without input:** The program can generate completely random melodies for experimentation.  
- **Hybrid approach:** Provide defaults for random generation but allow user input for customization.

---

## 📤 Output

The program produces a **melody sequence**. Possible output formats include:

- Plain text (e.g., `C4 quarter, E4 quarter, G4 half`)  
- CSV or Excel file (note, duration, beat)  
- Optional MIDI file export for playback in music software  

Example (text representation):

- C4 quarter
- E4 quarter
- G4 half

---

## 🎼 Representation

- **Notes:**  
  - Letters with octave numbers, e.g., `C4`, `D#5`  
  - Frequencies (optional), e.g., `440 Hz` for A4  
  - Strings combining pitch and duration, e.g., `C4_quarter`  

- **Duration:**  
  - Represented as fractions of a beat:  
    - `1` = whole note  
    - `0.5` = half note  
    - `0.25` = quarter note  

- **Data structure example:**

```python
melody = [
    ("C4", 0.25),
    ("E4", 0.25),
    ("G4", 0.5)
]
```


## 🧠 Logic

The logic of the composer can be structured in a **modular way**:

### Note Selection
- Randomly pick notes from the chosen scale
- Use weighted probabilities (e.g., tonic/root appears more often)
- Apply simple rules to avoid large leaps and favor stepwise motion

### Duration Assignment
- Assign random durations to notes that fit within each measure
- Ensure measures sum to the correct total beats

### Termination Conditions
- Stop after a fixed number of bars
- Or stop after reaching a target total duration

### Algorithm Steps
```text
1. Choose a scale
2. Randomly select notes from the scale
3. Assign durations for each note
4. Append notes to melody sequence
5. Repeat until target length is reached
```

## 🚀 Extensions

Potential extensions and challenges:

### Challenges for Longer Compositions
- Random generation may produce repetitive or unstructured music
- Advanced rules may be needed (chord progressions, rhythm patterns)
- Memory and performance issues with very long sequences

### Future Improvements
- Add rhythmic patterns, not just random durations
- Export to MIDI for actual playback
- Use AI/ML techniques to generate style-based compositions
- Include user-controlled themes or motifs
